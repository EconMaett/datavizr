## Get data ----
# FRED: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/
# tidyquant: https://business-science.github.io/tidyquant/

# We need to specify the internal code of the variables we want.
# The same measure is usually offered with different combinations of
# - real (adjusted for inflation)
# - nominal (not adjusted for inflation)
# - frequency (monthly, quarterly, or annually),
# - seasonally adjusted or not seasonally adjusted.

# For example, all GDP measures are listed here:
# FRED: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/106
# Typical examples are:
# - GDPC1:     Real (2012) dollars, quarterly, seasonally adjusted
# - ND000334Q: Real (2012 dollars), quarterly, not seasonally adjusted
# - GDPCA:     Real (2012 dollars), annual, not seasonally adjusted
# - GDP:       Nominal, quarterly, seasonally adjusted
# - GDPA:      Nominal, annual, not seasonally adjusted

# We need to feed the `tidyquant` function `tq_get()`:
# 1) A list of indicators
# 2) A source for those indicators
# 3) A start and/or end date

# The function can access financial data from Yahoo Finance,
# Bloomberg, Quandl (NASDAQ Data Link), and Tiingo and FRED.

# Make a new data set `fred_raw`
fred_raw <- tq_get(
  x = c(
    "RSXFSN",         # Advance retail sales

    "FPCPITOTLZGUSA", # Inflation

    "USREC"           # Recessions
  ),
  get = "economic.data", # Use FRED
  from = "1990-01-01"
)

# Downloading the data anew every time you want to knit your
# R Markdown document will get tedious. It is good practice to save 
# this data as a CSV file and then work with that.

# To make your code reproducible, set the `eval=FALSE`
write.csv(x = fred_raw, file = "data/fred_raw.csv")

## Look at and clean the data ----
# With World Bank data, you get data for every country and every year.
# With FRED data, the time might be spaced differently between different time series.

# The `tidyquant` R package gives you data in tidy, or long form,
# and only provides the three columns `symbol`, `date`, and `price`
head(fred_raw)

# The `tidyquant` R package was designed for stock price data,
# hence the `symbol` column includes the ID and the `price` column the values.

# We make a smaller retail sales dataset

# If multiple variables have the same spacing (annual, quarterly,
# monthly, weekly, daily), use filters to select all of them and

## Decomposition ----
# Use the free textbook "Forecasting: Principles and Practice"

# - `tsibble`: Add fancy support for time variables to tibbles.
# - `feasts`:  Decompose time series and other statistical things
# - `fable`:   Make forecasts.

# The retail sales data from FRED was not seasonally adjusted.
